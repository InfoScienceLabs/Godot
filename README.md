# Godot  
Godots is a multidroplet management software its architecured in a client server model,  
it has a comprehensive record of activities happening in the client side and capable of running remote commands on the client system.
this can be ideally used for running remote scripts across multiple servers and multiple accounts.  
Often there arises a case where we need to run scripts on multiple systems due to resource constraints or demographic reason.
so the godots helps in creating digitial ocean droplets as many as required and across multiple accounts. However these are subjected to the respective quotas available for the account.

### system requirements:
##### server:
linux server   
python 3.6+   
mysql 5.7+  
rsync    
sentry  

##### client:
linux server with specs required as per requirements  
python 3.6+  
rsync  
sentry  
VNC (optional for GUI)  

### use cases:  
1) GUI Testing  
2) datamining  
3) small scale multi server computing (not ideal meant)  
4) image processing across servers  
5) distributed API testing.
